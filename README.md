# Python Playground 🐍

This repo contains small projects, experiments, and practice scripts from my journey through *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*.  
These are not polished portfolio projects — just a record of my progress and practice.  

## Structure
Each folder corresponds to a chapter or concept:
- `chapter01_basics/` → number guessing game, calculator, text adventure
- `chapter03_strings_lists/` → list cleaning, name formatting
- `chapter05_dicts/` → word counter
- `chapter08_fileio/` → log cleaner
- etc.

## Purpose
- Practice Python fundamentals
- Experiment with automation concepts
- Build muscle memory before moving into real-world automation projects
